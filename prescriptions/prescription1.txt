Vitamins are organic compounds with proteins in the body chiefly to
create enzymes that work to regulate the body’s functionality. We cannot create
enough of our requisite vitamins physiologically, but they are easy to obtain
through diet. Most vitamin supplements on the market today are called
multivitamins. Obviously, this means that they contain multiple vitamins,
thirteen of which have been identified as needed by the body to function well:
vitamin A, eight kinds of vitamin B (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic
acid, B6, B12, folic acid, and biotin), vitamin C,
vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. Virtually all multivitamins contain
vitamins in doses that are several orders of magnitude larger than what you
need to prevent any deficiency-related ailment. For example, thirty milligrams
a day will prevent scurvy, which is what’s found in half of an orange. Some
multivitamins, however, will stock a whopping thousand milligrams of vitamin C
