Most people who drink a lot of milk won't have excessively high calcium levels. However, it is possible to reach excessively high calcium levels by drinking too much milk. Some suggest that 4000 mg of calcium per day can cause kidney stones and in extreme cases kidney failure.[8] That's about a gallon of milk a day — or some combination of food and some antacids — or some other combination of foods and dairy products. Of course, getting calcium is essential and needed, but there's a lot we don't know about whether a given amount of calcium is too much.
